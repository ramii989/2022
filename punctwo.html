        What had periods to do with it. Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to
        again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again stop
        some time then periods had to exist. Beside I had always like the look of periods and I liked what they did. Stopping
        sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and
        as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never stopped
        using them.
