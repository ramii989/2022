                And what does a comma do, a comma does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy
                enough without
                the comma. A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it
                and the comma,
                well at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath but if you want to take a
                breath you
                ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something
                to do with going
                on, but taking a breath well you are always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than
                another breath.
